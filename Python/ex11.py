# Most of what software does is the following:
# 1. Takes some kind of input from a person.
# 2. Changes it.
# 3. Prints out something to show how it changed.
#
print("How old are you?", end = ' ')
age = input()
print("How tall are you?", end = ' ')
height = input()
print("How much do you weight?", end = ' ')
weight = input()

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")

# end of script #
