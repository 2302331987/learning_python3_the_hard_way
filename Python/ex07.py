# Purpose:  Exercise 7: More Printing
# Date:     February 19, 2019
#

# the beginning of a bunch of exercises where I just type code in and
# make it run.

print("Mary had a little lamb.")
print("Its fleece was white as {}.".format('snow'))
print("And everywhere that Mary went.")
print("." * 10) # repeats the '.' character 10 times

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch end = ' ' at the end. try removing it to see what happens
# note: with end = ' ', the second print statement is concatendated onto
#       the first print statement.
#       without it, the two statements are printed on separate lines
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end = ' ')
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)

# great note at the end:
# programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are
# perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act.
# They make mistakes all the time.

# end of script #
