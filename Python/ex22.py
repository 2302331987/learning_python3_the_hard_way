# write down every and symbol that you have used
# make sure your list is complete

print('''
* # is known as pound, hash, and octothorpe. It is used for comments.
* print() is used to print text to console.
* Store numbers or text in objects called variables. While you can name them
anything you would like, be sure to spell them with lower case and snake_case.
* There's a whole host of mathematic characters, such as:
\t +: plus
\t -: minus
\t /: slash (division)
\t *: asterik (multiplication)
\t %: percent (modulus)
\t <: less than
\t >: greater than
\t <=: less than or equal
\t >=: greater than or equal
* print(f"I have seen over {movies_num} movies.") is called a format string
because it allows you to embed variables with a string.
Alternatively, one may use print("I have seen over {} movies".format('9000'))
to embed values in a string.
* input() captures user input data. You can nudge users to specify something
in particular by typing a string inside on input (i.e. input("Number 1:100")).
* Store many user inputs via argv from sys module. argv will only capture as
many input as there are variables to store them (i.e. var1, var2 = argv will
only store two users inputs, no more and no less.)
* open() opens a file object
* read() reads a file object
* readLine() reads a specific line in a text file.
* seek() moves the file to a specific bye in the file.
* truncate() shortens the file.
* close() closes a file object.
* write() writes a file object.
* def is used to write a function, which is a 'mini-script' used to perform an
operation within a larger script. Function names are lower case and snake_case.
The arguments are contained within a parentheses, which is followed by a colon.
The logic within the function is four spaces indented from def.
